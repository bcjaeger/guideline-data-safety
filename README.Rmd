# guideline-data-safety

The goal of guideline-data-safety is to demonstrate some helpful ways to keep sensitive information local while sharing the non-sensitive information (i.e., code) online.

## Using `.gitignore`

`.gitignore` is a special file used by git. Each line in the ignore file represents a pattern that git should not track. The video linked below walks through how you can set up a new project in Rstudio and designate a location where sensitive data will be stored and ignored by git.

## Using `.Renviron`

The `.Renviron` file saves variables that you can access from R using `Sys.getenv()`. It is very helpful for accessing passwords and other secrets you do not wish to put online. The video linked below walks through an example demonstrating how to add new variables to your `.Renviron` file and access them.
